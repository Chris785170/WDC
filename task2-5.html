            A page with some divs and spans
        </h1>
        <p>
            This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".<br>
            This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue"> this span of text is blue</span><span class="fancy">and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span><br>
            because they belong to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, <span class="blue fancy" >this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div><p>This text is inside a normal div,but the background has not been set.</p></div>
